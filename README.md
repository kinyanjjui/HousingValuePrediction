# HousingValuePrediction
This notebook is a walkthrough of Aurélien Géron's housing price prediction model using Califrornia Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository. This project is guided by his Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow with minor adjustments and modifications of my own.

It aims at predicting the median housing price for districts in California. Districts typically being geographical units comprising of 600-3000 people.

It shows the cycle of a simple machine learnig project from data sourcing, data cleaning, exploratory data anlysis and visualization, feature engineering to model training and inference.
